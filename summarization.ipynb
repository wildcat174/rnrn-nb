       " The landing by Odysseus today has moved the United States closer to its next giant leap in space exploration. “Today, for the first time in more than a half century, the U.S. has returned to the moon,” said NASA administrator Bill Nelson during the NASA broadcast. After a nail-biting descent, the United States took one small step back to the surface of the moon. A spindly robotic lander named Odysseus — designed and built by a private U.S. company — touched down near the moon’s south pole at about 6:23 p.m. Eastern time. The probe, which is carrying six NASA payloads plus a few other odds and ends, is the first U.S. vehicle to perform a controlled descent to the lunar soil since Apollo 17 landed in 1972. “I know this was a nail-biter but we are on the surface and we are transmitting and welcome to the moon,” Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said during a live NASA broadcast of the touchdown.

Odysseus’ destination was a flat region near the Malapert A crater, about 300 kilometers from the moon’s south pole. Odysseus, which stands about 4 meters tall and 1.5 meters wide, is hauling a half dozen NASA instruments designed to demonstrate equipment for future landings and better understand the environment near the south pole in service of planned astronaut missions. But most of the payloads are on the sides of the lander that are facing up, the team said, and the instruments appear to be operational and able to send information back to Earth. It’s been more than 50 years since astronaut Eugene Cernan left the last U.S. footprints on the moon. But he was also jubilant when reflecting about his team’s accomplishments."
